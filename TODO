Features:
  * Clicking *save* when working on multiple avs... should it save them all, or only the current one?
  * Warn about closing with unsaved files still open

Bugs:
  * when editing multiple animations, switching between them with a part selected causes both avs to be set to the data for one of them
  * clicking "cancel" in File load dialog, then clicking the view area, causes a segfault

Untested:
  * Saving / data integrity when working with multiple avs


== Animik ===============================================================================================================================
Features:
  * Rotate/pan of scene shouldn't unselect limb/prop. Only simple click on background.
  * Pan of scene on secondary mouse button+drag.
  * For now, just thing of this: what about adding possibility (context menu item) to set all frame weights to one level? (standalone dialog
    with a vertical slider, and a "Default (50)" button)
  * Setting limb weight in one frame for multiple limbs at once. Like
    + in 3D view of BlenderTab, keep clicking on limbs while holding Shift. All will be added to the selection.
    + right click. If an item on time-line is selected (hence a frame), context menu appears: "Set limb(s) weight".
    + after clicking the menu item, LimbsWeightDialog appears with prefilled weight value if all selected limbs have the same, otherwise 50.
  * Drag & drop of .BVH/.AVM/.AVBL files onto Animik window to open them.

Bugs:
  * After opening .avm file, the floor is not highlighted red if first frame is protected. After moving on another frame and back it already is
  * Tab/window title not flagged with asterisk when change done in TimeLineView by dragging.
  * Spotted on Win32. Open AVM, selecte a part, alter rotation. Tab is marked with '*', but after selecting another part, it
    disappears (like being saved).
  * Player loop-ing is independent from underlying Animation. The looping set on the Player should actually set it to the animation.
  * Somehow it's possible to have the same file in the Animation list multiple times. Needs investigation first.
  * It's posible to create file named ".avbl". For Windows' sake it rather shouldn't be.

Next task:
  * Show also GLOBAL rotation for each limb. Draw global (still) coordinate system around currently selected limb. And check Kundrat's work.
    (POSTPONED!)
