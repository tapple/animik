Features:
  * Clicking *save* when working on multiple avs... should it save them all, or only the current one?
  * Warn about closing with unsaved files still open

Bugs:
  * when editing multiple animations, switching between them with a part selected causes both avs to be set to the data for one of them
  * clicking "cancel" in File load dialog, then clicking the view area, causes a segfault

Untested:
  * Saving / data integrity when working with multiple avs

Features:
  * Rotate/pan of scene shouldn't unselect limb/prop. Only simple click on background.

Bugs:
  * After opening .avm file, the floor is not highlighted red if first frame is protected. After moving on another frame and back it already is
  * Global rotation angles are not displayed correctly when set with sliders
  * Modified file is not flagged with asterisk in tab/window title

Next task:
  * Show also GLOBAL rotation for each limb. Draw global (still) coordinate system around currently selected limb. And check Kundrat's work.
