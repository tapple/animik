Features:
  * Clicking *save* when working on multiple avs... should it save them all, or only the current one?
  * Warn about closing with unsaved files still open

Bugs:
  * when editing multiple animations, switching between them with a part selected causes both avs to be set to the data for one of them
  * clicking "cancel" in File load dialog, then clicking the view area, causes a segfault

Untested:
  * Saving / data integrity when working with multiple avs

Features:
  * Rotate/pan of scene shouldn't unselect limb/prop. Only simple click on background.

Bugs:
  * After opening .avm file, the floor is not highlighted red if first frame is protected. After moving on another frame and back it already is
  * Tab/window title not flagged with asterisk when change done in TimeLineView by dragging.
  * It's somehow possible to lose selected filename in AnimationList without 'Add to timeline' button being disabled. Causes SIGSEGV.
  * Spotted on Win32. Open AVM, selecte a part, alter rotation. Tab is marked with '*', but after selecting another part, it
    disappears (like being saved).
  * Player loop-ing is independent from underlying Animation. The looping set on the Player should actually set it to the animation.

  * INVESTIGATE FIRST: Place two different animations on Blender's timeline. Move the latter one on different track. Delete the left on first track.
                       Click on the remaining one (non-first track).

Bug-o-feature:
  * In the SaveChangesDialog it's possible to change the filename by double-clicking. Find if it's possible to save the file under
    different filename.

Next task:
  * Show also GLOBAL rotation for each limb. Draw global (still) coordinate system around currently selected limb. And check Kundrat's work.
